# Koda JavaScript Coding Challenge

## Overview

Your challenge is to create a simple, 10 question, true or false, trivia app in the technology you are familiar with. While the problem you are working on is simple, you should treat this like a real world application. This is a chance to show off your abilities and impress.

**What we are looking for through this challenge:**

- Functionality
- Code Format
- Project Structure
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Use of industry best practices

## Goals

Implement the screens based on the wireframes and api below using advanced techniques and industry best practices for your platform. Note that the wireframes may not be complete, so use your best judgment for UI/UX implementation. **Do not use a boilerplate like React Boilerplate for this challenge.** We want to see how you structure your project and what tooling you use from scratch. Create react app is fine to use.

## Steps

#### 1. Fork this repo and use web-app folder as code boilerplate to start
#### 2. Server:
Please setup a node.js server to load data from `server/data/questions.json` and serve as an api for the frontend

#### 3. UI requirement:
We provide the design for the trivia app. You can check the figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/jv7BCh5IYu6xovF6zHy8Ab/Koda-React-Coding-Test?node-id=0%3A1). You don't need to follow exactly the same if you do not have enough time. We want to see your general HTML/CSS skills and how you behavior when converting a design into a real product. `(Logo and background image are located in web-app/src/images)`
